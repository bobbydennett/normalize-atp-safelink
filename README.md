# normalize_atpsafelink
Python script that normalizes a URL which has been rewritten by Microsoft ATP SafeLink protection.

Disclaimer: The script reveals the destination of a Microsoft SafeLinks URL without having to click on the URL. Please be cautious using this script to bypass a SafeLink. Visiting a decoded link directly instead of via its SafeLinks URL increases your risk of ending up at a malicious website.
